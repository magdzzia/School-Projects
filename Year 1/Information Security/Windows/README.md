# User Management Lab
### Mark: 95
#### Goal: Create 3 different users on the Windows OS using different methods (Command Line, PowerShell, GUI) and provide different permissions for each.

### What I Learned:
1. Why I Got 95: There were a few select screenshots that shouldn't have been there as they were not under the correct category (ie. showing the command line steps under the GUI category)
2. The various methods of creating different users; command line commands, PowerShell commands, and GUI
3. How to enact different permissions for different groups/users and administratively enforce it
