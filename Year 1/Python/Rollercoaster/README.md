# Rollercoaster Field Trip Project
## Mark: 100
### Goal: Create a script that simulates a rollercoaster field trip - with dynamically changing lists when user choose different rollercoasters and different foods to pick from. Each rollercoaster and food should have it's own price and the user will receive their total cost at the end of the script.
