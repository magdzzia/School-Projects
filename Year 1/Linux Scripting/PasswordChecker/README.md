# Optimal Password Checker Project
## Mark: 95
### Goal: Validate a password that is provided through the script command-line interpreter

# What I Learned:
1. Why I Got 95: Under the parameters of the assignment, I was unable to find a way to bypass pattern matching for special characters without calling on special functions. There was another way, which is commented in the script, to use the echo read command which would have fully worked, however, was unable due to the expectations of the assignment.
2. Pattern-matching and the functions of different special characters
