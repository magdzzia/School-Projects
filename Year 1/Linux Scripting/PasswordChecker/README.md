# Optimal Password Checker Project
## Mark: 95
### Goal: Validate a password that is provided through the script's command-line interpreter

# What I Learned:
1. Why I Got 95: Under the parameters of the assignment, I was unable to find a way to bypass pattern matching for special characters without calling on special functions. There was another way I found after the grading, which is commented in the script, to use the echo read command which solves the issue.
2. Pattern-matching and the functions of different special characters
