# Find Hailstone Numbers Project
## Mark: 90
### Goal: Create a script that takes only one argument and finds the hailstone series for that number.

# What I Learned:
1. Why I Got 90: While determining improper syntax, I went on a case-by-case basis rather than one universal case, which made me lose out on certain cases. The way I would do that is by using && operators rather than going a for a case-by-case basis.
